# Well-Architected IaC (Infrastructure as Code) Analyzer

![solutions_diagram](/assets/wa_genai_app_diagram.png)

## Description 

Well-Architected Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Analyzer is a project that demonstrates how generative AI can be used to evaluate infrastructure code for alignment with best practices.

It features a modern web application built with React and AWS Cloudscape Design System, allowing users to upload IaC documents (e.g., AWS CloudFormation or Terraform templates) or architecture diagrams for assessment. The application leverages Amazon Bedrock to analyze the infrastructure against AWS Well-Architected best practices. These best practices are sourced from AWS Well-Architected whitepapers and synchronized with the Amazon Bedrock knowledge base.

This tool provides users with insights into how well their infrastructure code aligns with or deviates from established AWS best practices, offering suggestions for improving cloud architecture designs. For architecture diagrams, it can even generate corresponding IaC templates following AWS best practices.

The project deploys resources running on the following AWS services:
* Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
* Application Load Balancer
* Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)
* AWS Fargate
* Amazon S3
* AWS Lambda
* Amazon Bedrock
* Amazon Cognito (Optional - Check the [Authentication Options section](#authentication-options))

## Features

- Upload and analyze Infrastructure as Code templates:
  - CloudFormation (YAML/JSON)
  - Terraform (.tf)
- Upload and analyze architecture diagrams:
  - PNG format
  - JPEG/JPG format
- Generate IaC templates from architecture diagrams
- Real-time analysis against Well-Architected best practices
- Integration with AWS Well-Architected Tool
- Export analysis results and recommendations

## Installation and Deployment

You have three options for deploying this solution:
- Option 1: Using a CloudFormation Deployment Stack (Recommended)
- Option 2: Using a Deployment Script
- Option 3: Manual Deployment

### Option 1: Using a CloudFormation Deployment Stack (Recommended)

This option uses AWS CloudFormation to create a temporary deployment environment to deploy the Well-Architected IaC Analyzer solution. This approach doesn't require any tools to be installed on your local machine.

#### Prerequisites

You must enable **AWS Bedrock Model Access** to the following LLM models in your AWS region:
* **Titan Text Embeddings V2**
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2**
* To enable these models, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html).

#### Deployment Steps

1. Download the CloudFormation template: [iac-analyzer-deployment-stack.yaml](https://github.com/aws-samples/well-architected-iac-analyzer/blob/main/cfn_deployment_stacks/iac-analyzer-deployment-stack.yaml)

2. Open the [AWS CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home#/stacks/create?stackName=iac-analyzer-deployment-stack):
   - Make sure you are in the same AWS region where you enabled access to the LLM models

3. On the "Create stack" page:
   - Select "Upload a template file" and upload the `iac-analyzer-deployment-stack.yaml` template
   - Choose "Next"

4. On the "Specify stack details" page. Enter or change the stack name, then:
   - Change the stack parameters as needed. Check the [CloudFormation Configuration Parameters](#cloudFormation-configuration-parameters) section below for details
   - Choose "Next" until reaching the "Review" page and choose "Submit"
   - The deployment process typically takes 15-20 minutes.

The temporary deployment environment will deploy the Well-Architected IaC Analyze solution under a new stack named `WA-IaC-Analyzer-{region}-GenAIStack`.

After deployment completes, find the application URL in the stack outputs:
   - In the CloudFormation console, navigate to the **Outputs** tab of the stack named `WA-IaC-Analyzer-{region}-GenAIStack`
   - Look for the **FrontendURL** value

#### Post-Deployment Steps

1. If you enabled authentication with a custom domain:
   - Create a DNS record (CNAME or Alias) pointing to the ALB domain name

2. If you created a new Cognito user pool:
   - Navigate to the Amazon Cognito console
   - Find the user pool created by the stack (named "WAAnalyzerUserPool")
   - Add users who should have access to the application

3. Access your deployed application using the URL from the CloudFormation outputs (or your CNAME or Alias pointing to the ALB)

### Option 2: Using a Deployment Script

<details>

<summary>Expand this section for instructions using the deployment script:</summary>

#### Prerequisites

You must enable **AWS Bedrock Model Access** to the following LLM models in your AWS region:
* **Titan Text Embeddings V2**
* **Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2**
* To enable these models, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html).

Apart from enabling access to the model listed above, the following tools must be installed on your local machine:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (v18 or later) and npm
* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.11 or later) and pip
* [AWS CDK CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html)
* Either one of these container tools:
  * [Finch](https://github.com/runfinch/finch?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-finch)
  * [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) configured with [appropriate credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)

> **Note:** If you would like to change the default Load Balancer scheme, AI model or authentication options, check the [Configuration Options For Manual Deployments section](#configuration-options-for-manual-deployments) first before deploying.

1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/well-architected-iac-analyzer.git
cd well-architected-iac-analyzer
```

2. Make the deployment script executable:
```bash
chmod +x deploy-wa-analyzer.sh
```

3. Deploy with required parameters:
```bash
# Deploy using Docker
./deploy-wa-analyzer.sh -r us-west-2 -c docker

# Or deploy using Finch
./deploy-wa-analyzer.sh -r us-west-2 -c finch
```

The script will automatically:
- Check for prerequisites
- Set up the Python virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Deploy the CDK stack
- Provide post-deployment information

After successful deployment, you can find the Application Load Balancer (ALB) DNS name in:
1. The outputs of the `deploy-wa-analyzer.sh` script
2. The outputs section of the CloudFormation stack named `WA-IaC-Analyzer-{region}-GenAIStack` in the AWS Console

>   --region <aws-region>
> ```

</details>

## Configuration Options For Manual Deployments

<details>

<summary>If you are following either the Option 2 or 3 for deploying the solution, configuration parameters are managed from the `config.ini` file. Expand this section to learn more:</summary>

### Model Selection

If you want to use a different model than "Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2", update the config.ini with the correct [model ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-ids.html#model-ids-arns):
```ini
[settings]
model_id = anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0
```

> **Note:** This application has been primarily tested with "Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2". While other Bedrock models may work, using different models might lead to unexpected results. The default model ID is set to `anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0`.

### Load Balancer Scheme Selection

By default, this project will deploy the Load Balancer scheme as [**internal**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com./elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html#load-balancer-scheme) **(Private load balancer)**. To access the application, you will need to be in the private network connected to the deployed VPC, either via:
* VPC peering
* VPN
* AWS Direct Connect
* Other network connectivity solutions

If you need to change the load balancer scheme to [**internet-facing**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com./elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/how-elastic-load-balancing-works.html#load-balancer-scheme), you can modify the `public_load_balancer` parameter in the config.ini file:
```ini
[settings]
public_load_balancer = True
```
⚠️ **Security Warning**: If you change the load balancer to be **internet-facing**, make sure to also define the Authentication Options as per below. Otherwise, the application and all its functionalities will be accessible directly through the Internet without authentication. Proceed with caution and understand the security implications.

### Authentication Options

> **Note:** Before enabling authentication, make sure you have a valid AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate covering the DNS domain name (CNAME or Alias) that you plan to use to point to this application's ALB.
>
> **For Example:**
> * If you own the domain `*.example.com`
> * And you plan to access the application via `wa-analyzer.example.com` (with a CNAME or Alias pointing to the ALB deployed by this stack)
> * You must first [create or import a certificate in ACM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/gs.html) that covers either:
>   * `*.example.com`, or
>   * `wa-analyzer.example.com`
> * Then, you can add the certificate's ARN in the `certificate_arn` parameter below when deploying the stack

The application can be deployed with different authentication configurations managed via the config.ini file.

**A. Default Deployment (No Authentication)**
- HTTP listener only
- Can be deployed as public or private ALB
- Example settings in config.ini:
  ```ini
  authentication = False
  auth_type = none
  ```

**B. New Cognito User Pool**
- HTTPS listener with AWS Cognito authentication
- Creates a new Cognito user pool
- Self-signup disabled by default
- Example settings in config.ini:
  ```ini
  # In below example, "wa-analyzer.example.com" is the DNS alias that you would create pointing to the ALB deployed by this CDK stack
  authentication = True
  auth_type = new-cognito
  certificate_arn = arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id
  cognito_domain_prefix = your-domain-prefix
  allback_urls = https://wa-analyzer.example.com/oauth2/idpresponse
  logout_url = https://wa-analyzer.example.com
  ```

**C. Existing Cognito User Pool**
- HTTPS listener with existing AWS Cognito authentication
- Uses an existing Cognito user pool
- Example settings in config.ini:
  ```ini
  # In below example, "wa-analyzer.example.com" is the DNS alias that you would create pointing to the ALB deployed by this CDK stack
  authentication = True
  auth_type = existing-cognito
  certificate_arn = arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id
  existing_user_pool_arn = arn:aws:cognito-idp:<aws-region>:<aws-account-id>:userpool/<user-pool-id>
  existing_user_pool_client_id = <user-pool-client-id>
  existing_user_pool_domain = <your-existing-cognito-domain-prefix>.auth.<aws-region>.amazoncognito.com # Example using Cognito prefix domain: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-assign-domain-prefix.html
  # Or; existing_user_pool_domain = wa-analyzer-auth.example.com # Example of custom domain (e.g. wa-analyzer-auth.example.com): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-add-custom-domain.html)
  existing_cognito_logout_url = https://wa-analyzer.example.com
  ```

**D. OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
- HTTPS listener with OIDC authentication
- Compatible with any OIDC-compliant identity provider

If you plan to use OIDC authentication (`auth_type = oidc`), follow these steps:

1. **Before deployment**, create a secret in AWS Secrets Manager named `WAIaCAnalyzerOIDCSecret` containing your OIDC client secret **before** deploying the stack. The secret must be created in the same AWS region where you plan to deploy the stack:
   ```bash
   # Using AWS CLI
   aws secretsmanager create-secret \
     --name WAIaCAnalyzerOIDCSecret \
     --secret-string "your-oidc-client-secret" \
     --region <aws-region>

   # Or you can create it via the AWS Console:
   # 1. Go to AWS Secrets Manager console
   # 2. Choose "Store a new secret"
   # 3. Choose "Other type of secret"
   # 4. Enter your OIDC client secret as a plaintext value
   # 5. Set the secret name exactly as: WAIaCAnalyzerOIDCSecret
   # 6. Do not add any automatic rotation
   # 7. Complete the secret creation
   ```

2. Configure OIDC settings in config.ini:
   ```ini
   # Below is an example when using Okta as your OIDC IdP, refer to the config.ini file for more examples. 
   # In below example, "wa-analyzer.example.com" is the DNS alias that you would create pointing to the ALB deployed by this CDK stack
   authentication = True
   auth_type = oidc
   certificate_arn = arn:aws:acm:region:account:certificate/certificate-id
   oidc_issuer = https://<okta-tenant-id>.us.auth0.com/authorize
   oidc_client_id = <okta-client-id>
   oidc_authorization_endpoint = https://<okta-tenant-id>.us.auth0.com/authorize
   oidc_token_endpoint = https://<okta-tenant-id>.us.auth0.com/oauth/token
   oidc_user_info_endpoint = https://<okta-tenant-id>.us.auth0.com/userinfo
   oidc_logout_url = https://<okta-tenant-id>.us.auth0.com/v2/logout?client_id=<oidc-client-id>&returnTo=https://wa-analyzer.example.com (# Refer to https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/login/logout)
   ```

</details>

## Clean up

You have two options to remove all resources created by this solution:

### Option 1 - Using AWS Console (Recommended)

1. Open the CloudFormation console
2. Find and delete the stack named `WA-IaC-Analyzer-{region}-GenAIStack`

### Option 2 - Using the Destroy Script

<details>

<summary>Only use this clean up option if you followed either Option 2 or 3 when deploying the solution. Expand for more details:</summary>:

1. Make the destroy script executable:
```bash
chmod +x destroy-wa-analyzer.sh
```

2. Run the script with required parameters. Make sure to use the same region where you deployed the stack:
```bash
# Clean up using Docker
./destroy-wa-analyzer.sh -r us-west-2 -c docker

# Or clean up using Finch
./destroy-wa-analyzer.sh -r us-west-2 -c finch
```

The script will automatically:
- Verify prerequisites
- Set up the necessary environment
- Destroy all resources in the stack

</details>

## Local Development

For development purposes, you can run the application locally using either Finch or Docker containers. This allows you to make changes to the code and see them reflected immediately without having to deploy code changes into your AWS stack.

### Prerequisites for Local Development

In addition to the main prerequisites, ensure you have:
* Either Finch or Docker installed and running
* AWS credentials configured with access to required services
* Access to Amazon Bedrock service and the required models (as described in the main Prerequisites section)

### Setting up Required AWS Resources

> **Note for Existing Stack Users**: If you have already deployed this CDK stack in your AWS account, you can skip the manual resource creation steps below. Instead:
> 1. Go to the CloudFormation console and find your stack (it starts with "WA-IaC-Analyzer-")
> 2. In the "Outputs" tab of the CDK CloudFormation stack, find:
>    - `KnowledgeBaseID`: Use this value for KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID in your .env file (for "Setting up Local Development Environment" section below)
>    - `WellArchitectedDocsS3Bucket`: Use this value for WA_DOCS_S3_BUCKET in your .env file (for "Setting up Local Development Environment" section below)
> 
> If you haven't deployed the stack yet, follow the steps below to create the required resources manually:

1. Create an S3 bucket:
   ```bash
   aws s3 mb s3://your-knowledgebase-source-bucket-name --region your-aws-region
   ```

2. Upload Well-Architected documents:
   ```bash
   aws s3 cp ecs_fargate_app/well_architected_docs/ s3://your-knowledgebase-source-bucket-name/ --recursive
   ```

3. Create a Bedrock Knowledge Base:
   - Go to the Amazon Bedrock console
   - Navigate to Knowledge bases
   - Choose "Create knowledge base with vector store"
   - Enter a name for your knowledge base
   - Select "Amazon S3" as the data source
   - Choose "Next"
   - Add your S3 bucket as a data source:
     - Choose the bucket you created
     - Leave all other settings as default
     - Choose "Next"
   - Select "Titan Text Embeddings v2" as the embedding model and use the default Vector database settings
   - Choose "Next" and Complete the knowledge base creation
   - Note the Knowledge Base ID from the details page

### Setting up Local Development Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```ini
# AWS Authentication
AWS_REGION=your-aws-region-key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token

# Well-Architected Framework Resources
WA_DOCS_S3_BUCKET=your-knowledgebase-source-bucket-name
KNOWLEDGE_BASE_ID=your-kb-id
MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0

# Storage Configuration
STORAGE_ENABLED=true
ANALYSIS_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-analysis-storage-bucket-name
ANALYSIS_METADATA_TABLE=your-analysis-metadata-table-name
```

> **Security Note**: It is encouraged the use of temporary credentials (including AWS_SESSION_TOKEN) when running the application locally. More details in [Temporary security credentials in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html). Temporary credentials have a limited lifetime and automatically expire, providing an additional layer of security.

> **Storage Configuration Notes**: 
> - If you have already deployed this CDK stack in your AWS account:
>   1. Go to the CloudFormation console and find your stack (it starts with "WA-IaC-Analyzer-")
>   2. In the "Outputs" tab, find:
>      - `AnalysisStorageBucketName`: Use this value for ANALYSIS_STORAGE_BUCKET
>      - `AnalysisMetadataTableName`: Use this value for ANALYSIS_METADATA_TABLE

1. Make the development script executable:
```bash 
chmod +x dev.sh
```

1. Start the development environment using either Docker or Finch:
```bash
# Using Docker
./dev.sh -c docker -up

# Or using Finch
./dev.sh -c finch -up
```

This will:
- Build and start the frontend container (available at http://localhost:8080)
- Build and start the backend container (available at http://localhost:3000)
- Enable hot reloading for both frontend and backend changes
- Mount source code directories as volumes for immediate updates

4. To stop the development environment:
```bash
# Using Docker
./dev.sh -c docker -down

# Or using Finch
./dev.sh -c finch -down
```

### Development Commands Reference

```bash
# Start development environment
./dev.sh -c <container_tool> -up

# Stop development environment
./dev.sh -c <container_tool> -down

# Show help and usage information
./dev.sh -h
```

Where `<container_tool>` is either `docker` or `finch`.

### Switching Between Development and Production

- Local development uses `finch-compose.dev.yaml` for container configuration
- Production deployment continues to use CDK as described in the Installation and Deployment section
